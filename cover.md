Hello!
======


*My name is Kirill. I live in Minsk, and I love writing code.*


I’ve been programming in some form since I was 16 years old. At the university(BSUIR) I gained a strong foundation in computer science theory in addition to experience in actual software development through several internships, side projects, and a couple of entrepreneurial endeavours.

For the about two years since graduating, I’ve been in the mobile advertising services industry. At GPN I worked on client side JavaScript application for native sdks (written with AngularJS and CoffeeScript) and on server side (Ruby on Rails) dealing with reporting stuff and complex mobile advertising system. Also I was involved in maintaining and improving API (tiny Sinatra app with Grape endpoint).

On the side, I am developing a project, that, I hope, will grow in SaaS to help me and other developers in daily workflow with GitHub. It’s not open-sourced yet, but will be after release.

I am looking for the next place I can make a significant contribution. While I write mostly Ruby and JavaScript at work currently, I’ve spent various stretches in the past working in C/C#, Python, and Elixir/Erlang. My favourite thing to do in my spare time is learn. Thus, I am a quick learner and I’m able to rapidly get up to speed in a new environment. I have a special place in my heart for the Web, and would love to work on problems at a large scale. I’m a down-to-earth dude who is passionate about technology, loves a good technical conversation, and I’m anxious to work with others like me.
